United States presidential election, 2016
The United States presidential election of 2016 is scheduled for Tuesday, November 8, 2016. It will be the 58th quadrennial U.S. presidential election. Voters in the election will select presidential electors who in turn will elect a new president and vice president of the United States. The incumbent president, Barack Obama, is ineligible to be elected to a third term because of the term limits established by the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution which do not allow a president to be elected to more than two complete terms.


== Background ==

Article Two of the United States Constitution provides that for a person to be elected and serve as President of the United States, the individual must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for a period of no less than 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the various political parties of the United States, in which case each party devises a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf.
The incumbent, President Barack Obama, a Democrat and former U.S. Senator from Illinois, is ineligible to seek reelection to a third term due to restrictions of the Twenty-second Amendment,; his term expires on January 20, 2017. In the United States presidential election, 2008, Obama was elected president, defeating the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, receiving 52.9% of the popular vote and 68% of the electoral vote.
He was reelected in the 2012 election, defeating former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, receiving 51.1% of the popular vote and 62% of the electoral vote. During his second term, President Obama's approval ratings have been listed by Gallup as between 40 and 50 percent.


=== 2012 election ===
In the 2012 election, incumbent President Barack Obama defeated former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, with 51.1% of the popular vote and 332 of 538 electoral votes. A CNN article published on the day of the election listed a few examples of imprudent remarks made by Romney during the campaign, Obama's poor performance during the first presidential debate, speeches made at the parties' respective national conventions, as well as some current events (such as Hurricane Sandy and the 2012 Benghazi attack) as the defining moments of the 2012 election. Romney was surprised by the loss and had not prepared a concession speech until after the major networks began predicting Obama's reelection.
Speculation about the 2016 campaign began almost immediately following the 2012 campaign, with New York magazine declaring the race had begun in an article published on November 8, 2012, two days after the 2012 election. On the same day, Politico released an article predicting the 2016 general election may be between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, while a New York Times article named Chris Christie and Cory Booker as potential candidates.


=== 2014 midterm elections ===
In the United States elections for the Senate and House in 2012, Republicans retained their majority of seats in the House of Representatives despite minor losses while Democrats increased their majority in the Senate. Subsequently, in the 2014 midterm elections, the Republicans won a majority of seats in both Houses of Congress, increasing their majority in the House and gaining a majority in the Senate.

Former First Lady, former Senator from New York, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton became the first Democrat to announce a candidacy for the presidency, which she did via a video on April 12, 2015.

Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders became the second candidate when he made a formal announcement on April 30 that he was running for the Democratic nomination. While not the front-runner, as of July 1, Sanders's campaign stops have been drawing the largest crowds of any of the candidates in the run for president.

== Potential battleground states ==

In every state except Maine and Nebraska, the winner of the popular vote in the state wins all of the electoral votes of the state (although state legislatures can, by law, change how votes are allocated). Recent presidential campaigns have generally focused their resources on a relatively small number of competitive states. Potential battleground states include Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida. Democrats have discussed targeting Arizona, Georgia, and Texas as potentially competitive states. Meanwhile, Republicans may also target Minnesota and New Jersey. Other states may also become competitive if the close races of 2016 differ from the close races of the 2012 election, or if 2016 becomes a landslide election. Both major parties might decide to target the home states of their nominees or that of their running mates if they are from a swing state or have high favorability in the state or region.

July 25–28, 2016: Democratic National Convention to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

=== Debate lawsuit ===
On June 22, 2015, the advocacy group Level the Playing Field, along with Peter Ackerman, the Green Party, and the Libertarian National Committee, filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Federal Election Commission in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that its failure to uphold debate fairness laws and address the corruption of the CPD after multiple unresolved requests to do so intentionally excluded third parties from the election process. While a decision has not yet been reached, the FEC did take up the original complaint in a July 16 meeting, with a motion to open rulemaking failing 2–4 (Commissioners Ravel (D) and Weintraub (D) voting aye and Commissioners Goodman (R), Hunter (R), Petersen (R), and Walther (D) voting no).
