Tillingdale
Tillingdale, originally Tillingdale Limited, is an Irish company based in Mullingar, Ireland. It was founded in 2000 to provide furniture management and horse breeding services under the name Gigginstown House Stud. Since 2003, Tillingdale has also operated under the name O'Leary Cabs, a provider of taxicab services.
The company is owned entirely by Michael O'Leary, CEO of the Irish airline Ryanair. During the year 2004, the company made a profit of approximately €500,000. In 2013 the company was converted from a limited company to a privately owned unlimited company, meaning that public accounts no longer needed to be filed.

The stud farm operation owns the 2006–Cheltenham Gold Cup winning horse "War Of Attrition".

The company owns a 2007–Mercedes-Benz S-Class taxi, with Mullingar hackney carriage licence MG99 purchased on a yearly basis from Westmeath County Council for upwards of €6,000. The vehicle has a taxi meter fitted and is allowed to use bus lanes within Dublin.
