Turia Pitt
Turia Pitt is an Australian mining engineer, burns survivor, motivationalist and author.
Pitt was competing in an ultramarathon through Western Australia's Kimberley region in 2011 when she was caught in a bushfire. An inquiry into the Kimberley Ultramarathon was damning of the race organizers, RacingThePlanet. She suffered burns to 65% of her body and had four fingers from her left hand and her right thumb amputated. She launched Supreme Court action against the organizers, and in May 2014, it was reported that it was resolved with an out-of-court settlement.
The organizers of the event, RacingThePlanet, were harshly criticised for their negligence and incompetence through a Parliamentary inquiry conducted by the Australian Government.
Pitt was named the New South Wales Premier's Award for Woman of the Year 2014, and she was a finalist for Young Australian of the Year. She is an Ambassador for Interplast Australia & New Zealand, and has graced the cover of The Australian Women's Weekly, which attracted world-wide media attention.
She is also a humanitarian, and raised close to $200,000 for Interplast by taking on a section of the Great Wall of China.
