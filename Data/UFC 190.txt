UFC 190
UFC 190: Rousey vs. Correia was a mixed martial arts event held on August 1, 2015 at the HSBC Arena in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.


== BackgroundEdit ==
The event was headlined by a UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship bout between current champion Ronda Rousey and #5 contender Bethe Correia.
The lightweight and bantamweight finals of The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil 4 also took place at this event. The finale was initially planned to take place on June 27, 2015 in São Paulo, Brazil. However on May 15, the event was moved to the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida. It was expected to be the first time a Ultimate Fighter Brazil Finale would take place outside of Brazil. However, as the event approached, several international fighters experienced potential travel restrictions due to technical issues within the Bureau of Consular Affairs division of the U.S. State Department which produces visas. This led to a situation in which several participants might have been barred from being able to compete. Subsequently, the divisional finals of The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil 4 were shifted to this event.
The event featured a potential UFC Women's Strawweight Championship title eliminator bout between Cláudia Gadelha and former WSOF Women's Strawweight champion Jessica Aguilar.
