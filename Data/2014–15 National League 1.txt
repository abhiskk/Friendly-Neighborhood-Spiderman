2014–15 National League 1
The 2014–15 National League 1, known for sponsorship reasons as the SSE National League 1 is the sixth season of the third tier of the English domestic rugby union competitions, since the professionalised format of the second tier RFU Championship was introduced; and is the twenty-eighth season since league rugby began in 1987. Ealing Trailfinders are the champions and return to the RFU Championship following their relegation from that league last season. The last three clubs are relegated; Old Albanian to National League 2 South, and Tynedale and Macclesfield to National League 2 North


== Structure ==
The league consists of sixteen teams with all the teams playing each other on a home and away basis to make a total of thirty matches each. There is one promotion place and three relegation places. The champions are promoted to the Greene King IPA Championship and the bottom three teams are relegated to either National League 2 North or National League 2 South depending on the geographical location of the team.


== Participating teams and locations ==

Twelve of the sixteen teams participated in last season's competition. The 2013–14 champions Doncaster Knights were promoted to the RFU Championship and are replaced by Ealing Trailfinders who only spent one season in the league above. The three relegated teams were all promoted in 2012–13 and stayed one season in National League 1; Henley Hawks and Worthing Raiders are relegated to National League 2 South and Hull Ionians to National League 2 North. The promoted teams are Hartpury College and Macclesfield champions of National League 2 South and National League 2 North respectively, and Darlington Mowden Park who won the promotion play-off against Ampthill & District.
