== Early life ==
Willie Maxwell was raised in a housing project in Paterson, New Jersey. He began taking interest in music in 2013. Initially starting off as only a rapper, he later decided to start singing as well because he "wanted to do something different." He was nicknamed "Fetty" (slang for money) as he was known for making money. "Wap" was added to the end of the name to perform under in tribute to his favorite rapper Gucci Mane. When he was a child, Wap developed glaucoma in both eyes. He revealed in a 2015 interview that doctors were unable to save his left eye and instead fitted him with an ocular prosthesis.

=== 2014â€“present: Debut album ===
Wap's first single was released in early 2014 titled "Trap Queen." He made the song in February 2014, but it did not start to gain recognition until mid-November 2014, and since then it has become a platinum record and has over 80 million plays on SoundCloud. His debut mixtape, Fetty Wap: The Mixtape was originally set for release in February 2015 but was delayed because he continued to create new songs. On June 29, 2015, Wap released his second single "679." The song's accompanying music video premiered on YouTube in May. His next single, "My Way", became his second top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.
In June 2015, Fetty Wap was awarded the MC100 Award of 2015 by Music Choice, for the most played music video for his hit single "Trap Queen." During the week of July 26, 2015 to August 1, 2015, the rapper matched Billboard marks by hip-hop superstars Eminem and Lil Wayne. He became the first male rapper with three songs occupying the top 20 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 chart since Eminem did so in 2013 (with "Rap God," "Berzerk," and "The Monster"). He also became the first male rapper in four years to have concurrent singles reach the top 10 of the same chart since Lil Wayne did so in 2011.

== Influences ==
Wap uniformly wears the flag of Haiti and does so in honor of his daughter's grandmother who had passed. Throughout the process of wearing it, he did some background research, and developed a love and appreciation for the Haitian culture. He quotes one of Haiti's national motto's, "unity brings strength" (l'union fait la force), and the importance on how unity has built his career and how it overpowers everything. He explains that he didn't really grow up out of love and mentions the struggles he has had, but the mutual love for the Haitian people are strong and supportive, and urges that he does not wear the flag for the looks.
