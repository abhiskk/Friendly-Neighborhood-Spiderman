SummerSlam (2015)
SummerSlam (2015) is an upcoming professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by WWE. It will take place on August 23, 2015, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York City, New York. It will be the twenty-eighth event under the SummerSlam chronology, and the first since 2008 to be held outside of Los Angeles as Staples Center was the exclusive home for SummerSlam from 2009 to 2014. This is to be the 8th SummerSlam to be held in New York metropolitan area after the 1988, 1989, 1991, 1997, 1998, 2002, and 2007 editions. The Izod Center was originally supposed to host SummerSlam, but due to its closure in April 2015, the event was moved to the Barclays Center. The event will also be the first in the SummerSlam chronology to be four hours in length, a length previously reserved only for WrestleMania.


== Background ==

SummerSlam will feature professional wrestling matches that involved wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines that play out on WWE's primary television programs, Raw, SmackDown and NXT. Wrestlers will portray heroes (faces) or villains (heels) as they follow a series of events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches.
At WrestleMania XXX in 2014, Brock Lesnar defeated The Undertaker to break his undefeated WrestleMania streak. Four months later, Lesnar defeated John Cena at SummerSlam to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, but lost it the following year at WrestleMania 31 in his match against Roman Reigns when Seth Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and won the title. Lesnar received his rematch against Rollins at Battleground, and was closing in on the win when The Undertaker returned and attacked Lesnar, causing the match to end in an inconclusive finish due to Rollins and the referee disappearing from the ring. This was initially reported as a "no contest", but the following night on the July 20 episode of Raw, Lilian Garcia announced Lesnar as the winner by disqualification. Also on the same night, it was announced that Undertaker would face Lesnar in the main event of SummerSlam. This will be Undertaker's first SummerSlam match since 2008, and his first pay-per-view match outside of WrestleMania since Bragging Rights in 2010.
