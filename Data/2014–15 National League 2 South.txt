2014–15 National League 2 South
The 2014–15 National League 2 South is the sixth season of the fourth tier of the English domestic rugby union competitions since the professionalised format of the second division was introduced. New teams to the division include Worthing Raiders (relegated from National League 1), Dorking and Old Elthamians (both promoted from National League 3 London & SE) and Lydney (promoted from National League 3 South West). At the end of the season the champions are automatically promoted to National League 1 while the second placed team will play against the runner-up from the 2014–15 National League 2 North with the winner of this game promoted. The bottom three ranked teams are relegated to either National League 3 London & SE or National League 3 South West depending on geographical location (in some cases teams may join the Midlands regional leagues).
During the course of the season the two league derby games between the Cornish All Blacks and Redruth would also double up as the Cornish Super Cup with the Cornish All Blacks being the defending 2013–14 champions. Redruth won over two razor edge contests to take the 2014–15 Cornish Super Cup 29 – 28 on aggregate. Henley Hawks finished the season as champions and booked themselves an immediate return to National League 1 for the 2015–16 season by securing the league title and promotion on 28 March 2015, beating Shelford 66 – 17 at Dry Leas.
While Henley gained promotion early, the battle for second spot (and the chance to go up via the play-off) went right to the last day of the season with three teams looking to go up — Bishop's Stortford, Dorking and Taunton Titans. In the end, all three teams had bonus point victories but Bishop's Stortford's slender two point lead at the start of play meant they would finish as league runners–up. With only three victories all season Dings Crusaders were the first team to be relegated, followed some time later by Shelford with the third relegation spot much more keenly contested. A dramatic last day saw Lydney competing against Southend Saxons to avoid the drop. Lydney won their game with the maximum 5 points they needed but Southend managed to get a losing bonus point in their game and stayed up thanks to a better win record. Dings and Lydney would drop to National League 3 South West while Shelford would drop to National League 3 London & SE.
League runners up Bishop's Stortford would go into a playoff against the runners up from National League 2 North, Ampthill, with Ampthill getting home advantage due to their better league record. It was the second time in a row that Ampthill were in the playoffs after somewhat ironically finishing second in National League 2 South the previous season. Bishop's Stortford lost a close game at Dillingham Park 10-19, with Ampthill gaining promotion to National League 1 for the 2015-16 season. In terms of attendances, National League 2 South had a total of 94,033 fans turning up for games across the season - up 14,405 from the previous season. This was helped by regular crowds at Cornish All Blacks and Redruth with 1,000+ attendances in the matches between the two Cornish sides while the two Cambridge - Shelford derby games attracted the biggest crowds of the season.

=== Promotion play-off ===
Each season, the runners-up in the National League 2 South and National League 2 North participate in a play-off for promotion into National Division 1. Ampthill were runners-up in the North and because they had a better record than the South runners-up, Bishop's Stortford they hosted the play-off match.
