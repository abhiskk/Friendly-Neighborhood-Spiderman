=== Strikeforce ===
She later signed to fight for Strikeforce, which greatly increased the chance that a fight with Gina Carano would take place. In her Strikeforce debut, Justino faced Hitomi Akano on April 11, 2009 at Strikeforce: Shamrock vs. Diaz. Justino came in six pounds overweight for the fight. Akano originally rejected the fight due to Justino failing to make weight but later accepted the fight. Justino defeated Akano by TKO in the third round.
Before the fight with Carano, Justino was interviewed by mmaworldwide.com's reporter Aaron Tru. When asked how long it would take to submit Carano with a choke hold, Justino choked the interviewer out cold, in a matter of seconds.
Justino fought Gina Carano on August 15, 2009 at Strikeforce: Carano vs. Cyborg for the Women's Featherweight Championship. Justino won via TKO at 4:59 of the 5:00 first round. The card was the first time that a major promotion had featured a main event between women. After the match, Justino hugged Carano, and stated in her interview that she had the utmost respect for Carano, and that it was an honor to fight her.
Justino next defended her title against Dutch standout Marloes Coenen at a Strikeforce event on January 30, 2010. Justino won the fight via TKO at 3:40 of round 3.
Strikeforce CEO Scott Coker stated that the next challenger for Justino would most likely be Erin Toughill. However, Toughill later announced her intentions to leave Strikeforce and plans for the fight with Justino were cancelled.
On April 7, 2010, Coker stated that Justino would fight again in June. She faced Jan Finney at Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Werdum and won the fight via KO in the second round. Justino's contract with Strikeforce expired on June 26, 2011. She renewed her Strikeforce contract on August 25, 2011.


==== Banned substance use ====
On September 23, 2011, Strikeforce announced that Justino would return to the promotion to face Hiroko Yamanaka. The fight took place at Strikeforce: Melendez vs. Masvidal on December 17, 2011. Justino won via TKO just sixteen seconds into the first round; however, on January 6, 2012, it was announced that Justino had tested positive for stanozolol, an anabolic steroid. As a result of the banned substance, the fight's result was changed to a no decision. Justino had her license suspended for one year and was fined $2,500.


=== Invicta Fighting Championships ===
On February 15, 2013, a month after Strikeforce folded, Justino signed a multi-fight deal with Invicta Fighting Championships. She was scheduled to make her debut on April 5 at Invicta FC 5: Penne vs. Waterson against Ediane Gomes to determine who would move on to face Marloes Coenen. However, Gomes suffered an injury and Justino instead faced Fiona Muxlow. Justino was successful in her return, winning the bout via TKO in the first round.

She lost a five-round unanimous decision against Jorina Baars in a fight for the inaugural Lion Fight Women's Welterweight Championship in the co-main event of Lion Fight 14 in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States on March 28, 2014. Baars officially knocked down Justino in the first round with a head kick and in the fifth round with a spinning heel kick, although referee Tony Weeks missed at least two other occasions throughout the fight where a knockdown could have been issued. Justino hit the canvas from a front kick in one occasion and from a knee on another, both times they were ruled slips by the referee.
In February 2015, Justino returned to MMA defend her Invicta Featherweight title against Charmaine Tweet in the main event at Invicta FC 11. She successfully defended her title, winning the fight via TKO in just under a minute in the first round.
